# Additional Routing Techniques

## Introduction
In the previous unit we were able to display the list of departments using `mat-card`, `mat-list`, `*ngFor`, and `{{}}` (interpolation). With that now available, we want to route to a page where we can eventually enter hours for each employee that belongs to the deparment that we clicked on. When we come to the page we clicked on, we want load data that is specific to that department depending on extra information that we will pass to the router.
